# Projectile Motion
As Wikipedia says...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion

The equations are as follows:

At any time {\displaystyle t}t, the projectile's horizontal and vertical displacement are:

{\displaystyle x=v_{0}t\cos(\theta )}x=v_{0}t\cos(\theta ),
{\displaystyle y=v_{0}t\sin(\theta )-{\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}}y=v_{0}t\sin(\theta )-{\frac  {1}{2}}gt^{2}.
